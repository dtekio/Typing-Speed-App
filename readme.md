## **Typing Speed App**
This is a simple Python application that allows users to measure their typing speed by tracking the number of characters they type per minute.

## **Usage**
To use the app, simply run the typing_speed.py file using Python. The app will open a window with a text entry box, a start button, an end button, and a character per minute display.

To start typing, click the Start button. You can type any characters you like into the text entry box. The app will track the number of characters you type per second and update the display accordingly.

To end the typing session, click the End button. The app will display your final typing speed in characters per minute, as well as the amount of time you spent typing. You can then close the popup window by clicking the Close button.

## **Limitations**
This app has some limitations that you should be aware of:

* It only tracks the number of characters you type per minute, not the accuracy of your typing.
* It does not provide any feedback or guidance to help you improve your typing skills.
* It does not allow you to customize the appearance or functionality of the app in any way.
